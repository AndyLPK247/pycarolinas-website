          <h3 class="text-danger">Lightning Talks</h3>
          <p>
            At PyCarolinas, <b>all talks will be lightning talks.</b>
            A "lightning talk" is a brief talk about an interesting topic.
            They can show how to use a Python library, demo a cool project, or share lessons learned.
            Lightning talks give ordinary attendees a chance to share extraordinary things!
            Our lightning talks will be 5 to 10 minutes long.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should <em>you</em> give a lightning talk?
            <b>Yes, absolutely, YOU should give a lightning talk!</b>
            We want you to give a talk, whether you are a seasoned pro or a firt-time speaker.
            You don't need to be polished or perfect.
            As the Python community, we will completely support you!
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some ideas for lightning talks to inspire you:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How you used machine learning to solve a common problem</li>
            <li>How to start using Flask as a beginner</li>
            <li>How to write good test cases using pytest</li>
            <li>How you developed a new Python library</li>
            <li>How to use decorators in Python</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Possible topics are endless.
            You can sign up ahead of time to give a talk, or you can sign up on the day of the conference.
            We will open sign-ups here on the website when we make tickets available.

        <div class="info-section">
          <h3 class="text-danger">Collab Clusters</h3>
          <p>
            A "collab cluster" is a space for a group to work together on a project or a problem.
            At PyCarolinas 2020, we want to use the space we have to foster organic collaboration.
            We encourage you to form and lead a collab cluster, and to welcome others to join you!
            Here are some ideas for collab clusters:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Teaching others how to start using Web frameworks like Flask or Django</li>
            <li>Leading a tutorial on serverless Python</li>
            <li>Working together to resolve issues on an open source project</li>
            <li>Leading a group discussion on a topic like testing</li>
            <li>A station for people to get help on bugs or other Python problems</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can sign up ahead of time to lead a collab cluster, or you can sign up on the day of the conference.
            We will open sign-ups here on the website when we make tickets available.

        <div class="info-section">
          <h3 class="text-danger">Hallway Track</h3>
          <p>
            The "hallway track" refers to spontaneous encounters at the conference.
            They typically happen in spaces where people cross paths.
            We should have plenty of space for attendees to mix and mingle.
            Strike up conversations, share projects, and swap stickers!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-section">
          <h3 class="text-danger">Meals and Refreshments</h3>
          <p>
            Meals and refreshments are dependent upon sponsors.
            Right now, the only meal we intend to provide is a pizza lunch with soft drinks.
            We are open to providing morning coffee and possibly a dinner party, too.
            Please refer to the <a href="{{ url_for('sponsors') }}">sponsors</a> page
