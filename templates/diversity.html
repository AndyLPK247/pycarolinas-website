            Our goal is to create an inclusive, respectful conference environment
            that invites participation from people of all races, ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, religions, and sexual orientation.

              encourage participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect,
              tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live up to
              these principles. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are,

          <h3 class="text-danger">Improving Our Diversity</h3>
          <p>
            We're actively seeking to increase the diversity of our attendees, speakers, and sponsors
            through all conference planning activities and through dialogue with the larger communities we serve.
            This is an ongoing process through which we will learn, grow, and improve.
          </p>
          <p>Here are some ways you can help us build a more diverse conference experience:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Recommend appropriate speakers, volunteers, and leaders to the conference organizers
            </li>
            <li>
              Forward our call for proposals to relevant affinity groups with the message that we are looking for a diverse speaker roster
            </li>
            <li>
              Suggest to potential speakers that they submit a proposal during our Call for Proposals conference phase
              or sign up to give a lightning talk
            </li>
            <li>
              Organize community-based public speaking trainings and practice events
              (Ignite is one popular format)
            </li>
            <li>
              Suggest ways that the onsite conference experience can be more welcoming and supportive, free from intimidation and marginalization
            </li>
            <li>
              Share your ideas and best practices for how we can realize our vision
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We value diversity in the communities we bring together, and we welcome your
            contributions to bringing balanced representation of the richness of our
            collective human experience. Help us do this by following our
